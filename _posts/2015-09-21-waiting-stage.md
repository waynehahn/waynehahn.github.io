i guess you can imagine the power of anxiety waiting for results.  We have decided to get up everyday and keep busy, meeting with friends, going out to lunch etc, just keep moving and worry less.  Wayne had his CAT scan, PET scan & finally his MRI this past Sunday.  Johns Hopkins has a wonderful campus.  Nikki & I found one of the really nice courtyards while Wayne was getting his tests.  We packed our IPhones, IPads, crosswords, bottles of water and made ourselves comfortable.  Afterwards we try to plan lunch or dinner with friends. Exploring the buildings, Nikki and I found the Dome area and the statue of Christ.  The artwork throughout is amazing.  It's almost like being at an airport.  For techie people there are places to refuel your phones and computers.  We have spent most of our time in the Zayed Building waiting.....Hopkins is an incredible place.  We feel blessed, strong and are really optimistic that Wayne will get the care that he needs to beat this disease.
