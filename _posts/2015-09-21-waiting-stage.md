I guess you can imagine the power of anxiety waiting for results.  We have decided to get up everyday and keep busy, meet with friends, go out to lunch and/or dinner, just keep moving and worry less.  Wayne had his CAT scan, PET scan & finally his MRI this past Sunday.  Johns Hopkins has a wonderful campus.  It's like an airport without luggage!  Nikki & I found one of the really nice courtyards while Wayne was getting his tests.  We packed our iPhones, iPads, crosswords, bottles of water and made ourselves comfortable.  

Exploring the buildings, Nikki and I found the Dome area and the statue of Christ in the original main entrance (located on Broadway).  The artwork throughout Johns Hopkins is amazing.  We had plenty of time to explore during all of his tests.  We have spent most of our time in the Zayed Building waiting..... Hopkins is an incredible place.  We feel blessed, strong and are really optimistic that Wayne will get the care that he needs to beat this disease.
