Our oncologist is starting Wayne on a chemo pill combination called Xelox. 14 days on, 7 days off for the next 12 weeks.  The side effects are usually minimal, mild nauseau and hand/foot syndrome.  What is that?  It's sensitivity to cold in his fingertips and his toes.  Nikki & I are in disbelief about the latter symptom because I refer to him as my heating pad.  For once I may get my dream of an electric blanket!  Nikki had a similar reaction and everything had to be luke warm.  The good thing for Wayne is
that he gets to be home throughout the regimen.  He'll still need to go in from time to time for blood tests to make sure his counts are doing well.  He should not lose hair either.  Nikki started buying him hats just in case!
After the 12 weeks, more blood tests and some scans to see if it is has been effective.  He is happy about that.  Wayne's attitude is very upbeat and positive.  He's ready to squash those cancer cells!  
His oncologist, Dr Donehower, is personable and caring.  He told Wayne he could tell that he had a good support system with us. That made us feel good!  So please continue to pray for him, that the treatment will be effective enough to get him through to the next step.  We cannot thank our friends and family enough for all of your support!
