Wayne just keeps rolling on....  The first 4 days after his chemo "in-house" (fluid and nausea infusion), Wayne had every symptom that his doctor & nurse mentioned.  We thought he was pulling our leg at first. Who reading this doesn't know Wayne as a jokester, right??  He put his hands on the steering wheel and then later in the evening when he went into the refrigerator, the cold felt like it was a burning sensation on his hands.  Odd, isn't it. But that is a major side effect from his Xelox combination.  

The next day, guess what we did?  We went out and purchased some jersey gloves so he could stay independent & used the fridge (and other cold spots) at his convenience.  He was queasy and was getting fatigued easily.  He wasn't happy about it, but we were taking care of him - fixing his drinks, cooking, taking out the trash. He was not content because he likes to take care of us. After several days he was feeling much like his old self. He started cooking & doing his routine things. The minute he was telling Nikki & I how to do things, we knew he was feeling much better. 

We try to walk every day.  We ate out last night for the first time since the night before chemo and he was without his queasiness!  He only has 4 more days of pills then he gets a week long reprieve.  We may travel to the beach for a few days depending on the weather.  He is enjoying the phones calls, texts & emails from our friends.  We can't thank you enough for your continued love and support!  I don't know how people go through this kind of stress without their faith and the people that they love.  Keep the faith, keep him in your prayers and keep in touch!
