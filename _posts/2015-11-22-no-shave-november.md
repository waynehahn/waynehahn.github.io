Well, Nikki decided that for the Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, Wayne should join the [No Shave November](https://www.no-shave.org/).  That didn't take too much persuasion!  He looks cute, older but still real cute.  His skin is very sensitive and he was advised to refrain from shaving.  He might not be shaving, but that extra bit still needs some styling.  He's not ready for "Whisker Wars" yet!

Wayne's white blood count dropped a bit this month.  It should be 4.50 but it is 4.03.  This may be the reason for his short naps!  😊  
He looks wonderful, always ready to go somewhere & he refuses to stay home to lay around.  He remains so positive which makes life much easier for Nikki and I.  When he is doing good, we are doing good.  I do believe that God put us on this earth to be caretakers and we are good at that job, after 4 parents, Nikki's bout with breast cancer and now Wayne, I believe all that should have earned us the halo, at least!  👼

Wayne's completed part of his second cycle of his chemo treatment.  The first day is the chemo infusion, Oxaliplatin, along with the oral pills, Xeloda, that he continues to take 6 pills a day for 2 weeks.  It's like reliving Nikki's bout again in that there are plenty of Gatorades, mashed potatoes homemade soups & homemade noodles, crackers etc.  True to her word, Nikki has started her mashed potatoes repayment to Wayne.  He made them so many times for her.  

He will be tired Wednesday's chemo through Sunday, then we can start going out to eat again and taking our walks.  By the 3rd week, he is on a mission to get things done. His latest cravings are turkey and gravy with fries or mashed potatoes.  Last week we tried 3 different places (the Diner, Greenspring Inn & Joey Dee's Lounge) & decided his favorite was at Joey Dee's Lounge, off Loch Raven Blvd.  It's one of our favorite places for comfort food.  We are looking forward to his next craving.

He also had an appointment with Dr. Donehower, his most compassionate oncologist, which went well.  He is a really a caring physician.  He said he really hoped the treatments Wayne is undergoing are working as well since  his attitude and physical fortitude are going strong.

**Bumps Along the Road**

I guess it couldn't all go so perfect.  On Friday Wayne woke up in the early morning with cramps in his calves.  The pain was intense.  We tried the heating pad but by 6 pm he couldn't take it anymore.  Nikki & I took him to GBMC Emergency upon advice from doctor on duty at Hopkins.  We needed to get his electrolytes checked and to make sure there weren't any blood clots (which unfortunately is a very real side affect from the chemo). Luckily it was a visit that clocked under 4 hours!  Nikki & I were a wreck that he'd pick up germs, but would not wear a face mask!

>*Nikki's retelling:*
>>"He’s our rock, so it’s really been hard for me to adjust to seeing him sometimes get weakened by the Oxaliplatin.  But you would love, even though he can’t touch anything cold, he quickly puts on his gloves to open doors for mom & I.  Even when we went to the hospital & he could barely walk, he refused being dropped off or being transported in a wheel chair.  Even going in, he held the door for Mom & me."

All in all the doctor on charge said to just rest and use the heating pad for the pain in his calves.  This was just another side effect from the chemo infusion drug. Whew. 🙀 Never a dull moment around here!  But it could be worse so we are not complaining.  Just, please remember to get your colonoscopy.  Don't wait for 10 years.  Remember that Wayne had no symptoms, it doesn't run in his family.  It just showed up like an unwelcome guest who sneaked in and doesn't want to leave.  There is a CAE blood test to check that out.  I'm not sure why it's not a routine check for all of us.

We have found from the last 2 cycles that his first week isn't great after the Oxaliplatin infusion but we are hopeful that it will be strong enough to kill the red cells more that the white cells.  We can take 1 week of bad.  It's better than 10 days or 2 weeks.

 Hope you all had a great week!  Remember how much You mean to Us and Thank You for listening.  Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours!  Sending Love to all of you. 💙💙💙
