We waited anxiously for March 18th, the day that we prayed Dr Efron would be able to get the cancer out.  Dr. He was able to scan Wayne's liver, they took out 27 lymph nodes and they were all clear!  Dr. Efron is not only an excellent Colorectal Surgeon but an artist too!  His scar, which runs just under his chest about 12 inches long, is healing beautifully with his belly button in tact! ðŸ˜Š. Everyone was amazed by this!

My sister Jeanette, brothers, Mike & Dan, and our special friend, Eleanor, stayed with Nikki and I all afternoon until after surgery.  It was a long day but Nikki and I felt positive and we had so much faith in Dr. Efron and his team.  His eight day stay was at the Marburg Building, which is located in the historic building at Hopkins.  Everyone was so attentive to not only Wayne, but to Nikki and me.  I cannot say enough good things about our treatment at Johns Hopkins.  

We had so much TLC from our team.  We can only urge everyone reading this, to please get a colonoscopy. It had been 12 years since Wayne's last colonoscopy.  And his test was made by coincidence. Nikki went for a follow up to our primary doctor, Cheryl Grossman.  She suggested we were all overdue for our colonoscopies.  We decided to let Wayne go first, never dreaming that there would be a problem!  Wayne had never been in a hospital before.  He still has his tonsils.  When Dr. Corkum asked me to come back with Wayne when he came out of his test, I never expected him to tell us right then & there that Wayne had cancer in his colon and we needed to see a colorectal surgeon. 

We will see our beloved Dr. Donehower so that Wayne can have preventive chemo after his surgery which hopefully will start in May.  Then we hope to run away somewhere for a short vacation.

So please, as we are aging, we need to take care of ourselves and get these tests done to prevent a journey like Wayne had.  Had he gone sooner, maybe it would have been different but there had been no cancer in his family so we never imagined this outcome.  He had no symptoms whatsoever.  But we are making it through the this with the love, support and prayers from family and friends.  We can never thank you all enough!  Now we are sending you all our love and prayers for your support.

With love, Frani, Wayne & Nikki
