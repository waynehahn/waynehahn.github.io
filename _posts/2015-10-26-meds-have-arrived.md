We waited patiently for Wayne's chemo pills to arrive all day from the Pharmacy.  Someone had to be home to sign for them so we took turns running errands for the weekend.  We finally had an 7:45pm delivery.
While waiting we made a wonderful Shrimp Etouf√©e over rice for dinner.  I also made 3 apple/walnut cakes, 2 for gifts and one for us!  Even though the pills have arrived, Wayne cannot take them until Wednesday morning, his first chemo appointment.  He sees his oncologist to get his first infusion.  He is on a regime where he continues to take the pills daily for 14 days, then have 7 free days. He will continue this regime 3-4 times.  Hopefully this will shrink his tumor and kill the c cells.  

Wayne has been upbeat most of the time - except when anxiety decides to pay him a visit, which I believe is normal.  We are blessed with our special friends, who keep us busy with social functions & help us to lead a normal life.  We are looking forward to a long weekend in Florida & a few other quick getaways as long as Wayne tolerates the meds.  We only think positive in our home!  

The few drawbacks are that there are some friends who tell me that they don't know what to say.  You can only say " I don't know what to say except that I am here if you need me". There are never the perfect words when you know someone who is special in your life and you know they are in peril.  Just think positive with a smile. Wayne is on the phone more than Nikki & I together.

Wayne has really been overwhelmed at the outpouring of notes, emails, phone calls & getting together.  We have a big crew of warriors helping us fight this fight. Please know how much we appreciate you!  It would be so hard to go through this without you.  Love is in the air........
