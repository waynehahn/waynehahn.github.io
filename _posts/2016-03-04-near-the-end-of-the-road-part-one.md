Our final chemo treatment was over back on December 30, 2015.  None of us miss it, especially Wayne. We do miss visiting with Dr. Donehower, Wayne's oncologist, with his meticulous care and positive personality!

Our next appointment was with our Colorectal Surgeon, Dr. Efron, gave Wayne the news that he would not need radiation and that surgery could be planned.  Dr. He, his liver specialist, came in to tell us that since they cannot find the cancer on he liver!    

The surgery will go something like this:  Dr. He will give Wayne a sonogram in surgery to be certain that it is gone and not hiding anywhere. If it is hiding, he will cut it out and if it is not there, Wayne & his liver will be checked on a regular basis.  When Dr. He has finished, Dr. Efron will take over and take out he cancerous part of the colon. The surgery will take approximately 4-5 hours. The date of surgery Wayne's surgery will be March 18th, he will be in the hospital 5-7 days & hoping recovery will be tolerable!

We have been blessed with a wonderful Colorectal Team at Johns Hopkins, all of the specialists, their assistants, the chemo team at Green Spring, and Tam from Dr. Efron's Team. They were so open to our questions and they accepted us as Wayne's team too!
Your caring and prayers has gotten Wayne this far and we hope you will continue to keep Wayne in your prayers through he next phase. Funny thing is -- Wayne has never been in the hospital - he still has his tonsils!
