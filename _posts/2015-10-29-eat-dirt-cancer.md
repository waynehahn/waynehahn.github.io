![Dad and I at JHU chemo]({{ site.url }}/img/wayne-nikki-first-chemo.jpg)

You would have thought we were getting ready for a trip.  Everyone got up & got ready without the usual dreary morning feeling.  Even in the waking hours we remain positive.  Only the cats were confused when we left, "where are our treats?"  "Where is our mound of food."  They know the only time the 3 of us leave that early, it must mean trip which equals tons of food for them.

We were the first ones at the chemo center.  Even though we weren't much for being there so early, it turned out to be a good thing.  We had more private time with our nurse.  To be honest, once you've done chemo at Mercy, there's no comparison.  Mercy is so darn upbeat as are the chemo nurses.  Even dealing with the type of job they have, the nurses still make you feel good.  I still love to pop in the chemo area and say hi to the nurses when I am down there.  It's a little more business like at the Hopkins Greenspring center.  But we had a lovely nurse, Linda, who took care of Dad.  Best for Dad was that she inserted the Pic line on first try & he hardly felt it.  

It takes about 4 hours, which is much better than my all day treatment.  I was leery Dad would be super sick since he doesn't get much for pre-meds.  It must relate to they type of treatment he's getting.  He's done just fine as far as sickness and nausea.

The odd symptom which is most prevalent in his treatment is that he reacts to cold.  "???"  I bet that's what you're thinking.  We were too.  If he goes into the refrigerator, he cannot just pick up something.  Why?  It like an extreme prickly feeling he told us.  He needs to use gloves to maneuver around the refrigerator these days.  And his feet need to be covered when  he's walking, because the cold floor affects him as well.  Likewise for when he drinks or anything cold.  

Brrr.  His reaction to cold seems to be the worst he dealt with on Day One of treatment.  I've been keeping a calendar for him that he can record his general feeling each day.  They say how you feel from the beginning to the end of each treatment cycle is pretty much the same each time.  I did that during my treatment & it really helped.  

Water.  I told Dad if he can drink 3 Camelbak water bottles a day, he'll be so far ahead of the game.  And he needed to drink hot lemon water to flush out evil toxins.  We'll try to eat as clean as possible so that the chemo can kill the bad stuff & we won't let anymore sugars and stuff like that slow it down.

Walking.  I preach to everyone to walk walk walk.  Even if you can walk up & down the street, that's good.  One of the first people with cancer I knew was going through a heavy chemo.  After each round, she would come home and walk her dog around Patterson Park. She walked daily.  I did the same even when it was snowing, and I credit that not only to coping, but to conquering the demons that try to come up when you go through chemotherapy.

He has 12 days left of his oral chemo pills, and then a week off.  Thankfully it's been an uneventful experience.  What has made this momentous has been the continuing love & positive words of encouragement you have sent to him.  We even have a friend who is doing distant Reiki on him.  As we always seem to end these posts, we thank all of you.  Your love and support helps give us the strength to handle this "blip" in our life.  We pray it's a small enough journey that it is nothing more than a footnote in our life's history.  When we look back, what we want most to remember is how wonderful you all were to us.
