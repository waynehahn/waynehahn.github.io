          <p>Results are in. They found a small lesion on Wayne’s liver. We were quite devastated but they feel that they can do surgery to remove it. The Doctors feel like between chemo, radiation and surgery, this cancer can be removed over a 6-8 month period</p>

          <p>I guess you can imagine the power of anxiety waiting for results.  We have decided to get up everyday and keep busy, meeting with friends, going out to lunch etc, just keep moving and worry less.  Wayne had his CAT scan, PET scan &amp; finally his MRI this past Sunday.  Johns Hopkins has a wonderful campus.  Nikki &amp; I found one of the really nice courtyards while Wayne was getting his tests.  We packed our iPhones, iPads, crosswords, bottles of water and made ourselves comfortable.  Afterwards we try to plan lunch or dinner with friends. Exploring the buildings, Nikki and I found the Dome area and the statue of Christ.  The artwork throughout is amazing.  It’s almost like being at an airport.  For techie people there are places to refuel your phones and computers.</p>

          <p>We were recommended to see Dr. Donehower and Dr. Efron at Johns Hopkins by a friend. What a blessing that turned out to be. Wayne felt immediately comforted by their plan of action. A week of tests followed. Currently we are in the waiting stage for results. We were told that there were spots on his lung and liver but that could be scar tissue, we hope!</p>
