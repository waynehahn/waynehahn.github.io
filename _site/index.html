          <p>The hardest part of every illness is the waiting game. Waiting for appointments, waiting for results &amp; waiting, waiting,waiting.  We wouldn’t dare complain as we were so fortunate to get in with our doctors. Johns Hopkins is so different than I thought it would be.  We absolutely loved Mercy when Nikki started her treatments 4 years ago.  There wasn’t one thing about Mercy that we didn’t like.  Surprisingly, Hopkins has gained that “patient care” attitude.  We felt like we were the only patients there.  They could not be more caring.  As of now, the liver specialist, Dr. He, felt the spot was very small and he would take it out after chemo and radiation.  Our mode for Wayne is going to be 6 weeks of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation and 12 weeks off.  After that, Wayne will have surgery.  We feel very confident in our doctors and Wayne has a wonderful positive outlook.  We will get him through this.  We thank all our family and friends for their support. Wayne has been humbled by all the out pouring of prayers, notes &amp; cards.  We are blessed!</p>
