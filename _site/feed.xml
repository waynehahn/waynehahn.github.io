        <title>The Plan</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our oncologist is starting Wayne on a chemo pill combination called Xelox. 14 days on, 7 days off for the next 12 weeks.  The side effects are usually minimal, mild nauseau and hand/foot syndrome.  What is that?  It’s sensitivity to cold in his fingertips and his toes.  Nikki &amp;amp; I are in disbelief about the latter symptom because I refer to him as my heating pad.  For once I may get my dream of an electric blanket!  Nikki had a similar reaction and everything had to be luke warm.  The good thing for Wayne is
that he gets to be home throughout the regimen.  He’ll still need to go in from time to time for blood tests to make sure his counts are doing well.  He should not lose hair either.  Nikki started buying him hats just in case!
After the 12 weeks, more blood tests and some scans to see if it is has been effective.  He is happy about that.  Wayne’s attitude is very upbeat and positive.  He’s ready to squash those cancer cells!&lt;br /&gt;
His oncologist, Dr Donehower, is personable and caring.  He told Wayne he could tell that he had a good support system with us. That made us feel good!  So please continue to pray for him, that the treatment will be effective enough to get him through to the next step.  We cannot thank our friends and family enough for all of your support!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Waiting Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of every illness is the waiting game. Waiting for appointments, waiting for results &amp;amp; waiting, waiting,waiting.  We wouldn’t dare complain as we were so fortunate to get in with our doctors. Johns Hopkins is so different than I thought it would be.  We absolutely loved Mercy when Nikki started her treatments 4 years ago.  There wasn’t one thing about Mercy that we didn’t like.  Surprisingly, Hopkins has gained that “patient care” attitude.  We felt like we were the only patients there.  They could not be more caring.  As of now, the liver specialist, Dr. He, felt the spot was very small and he would take it out after chemo and radiation.  Our mode for Wayne is going to be 6 weeks of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation and 12 weeks off.  After that, Wayne will have surgery.  We feel very confident in our doctors and Wayne has a wonderful positive outlook.  We will get him through this.  We thank all our family and friends for their support. Wayne has been humbled by all the out pouring of prayers, notes &amp;amp; cards.  We are blessed!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MRI Results</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Results are in. They found a small lesion on Wayne’s liver. We were quite devastated but they feel that they can do surgery to remove it. The Doctors feel like between chemo, radiation and surgery, this cancer can be removed over a 6-8 month period&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Waiting Stage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess you can imagine the power of anxiety waiting for results.  We have decided to get up everyday and keep busy, meet with friends, go out to lunch and/or dinner, just keep moving and worry less.  Wayne had his CAT scan, PET scan &amp;amp; finally his MRI this past Sunday.  Johns Hopkins has a wonderful campus.  It’s like an airport without luggage!  Nikki &amp;amp; I found one of the really nice courtyards while Wayne was getting his tests.  We packed our iPhones, iPads, crosswords, bottles of water and made ourselves comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring the buildings, Nikki and I found the Dome area and the statue of Christ in the original main entrance (located on Broadway).  The artwork throughout Johns Hopkins is amazing.  We had plenty of time to explore during all of his tests.  We have spent most of our time in the Zayed Building waiting….. Hopkins is an incredible place.  We feel blessed, strong and are really optimistic that Wayne will get the care that he needs to beat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the Jesus statue known as the “Divine Healer” or “Christ the Consoler.” The Carrera marble Jesus has arms outstretched, open in a gesture of welcome to all who wander in.

        <title>What&#39;s Next</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We were recommended to see Dr. Donehower and Dr. Efron at Johns Hopkins by a friend. What a blessing that turned out to be. Wayne felt immediately comforted by their plan of action. A week of tests followed. Currently we are in the waiting stage for results. We were told that there were spots on his lung and liver but that could be scar tissue, we hope!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Beginning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On 9/2/2015, we created this site to keep it a little more personal than Facebook. Wayne had a routine visit for a colonoscopy. We found out immediately that our gastroenterologist, Dr. Corkum, said it appeared it was cancer in his colon.&lt;/p&gt;
