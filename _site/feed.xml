        <title>Optimistic and Strong</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we feel very optimistic &amp;amp; strong. We are keeping positive. Wayne’s appointment with the Liver specialist is on Friday so we will update after that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What&#39;s Next</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We were recommended to see Dr. Donehower and Dr. Efron at Johns Hopkins by a friend. What a blessing that turned out to be. Wayne felt immediately comforted by their plan of action. A week of tests followed. Currently we are in the waiting stage for results. We were told that there were spots on his lung and liver but that could be scar tissue, we hope!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Beginning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On 9/2/2015, we created this site to keep it a little more personal than Facebook. Wayne had a routine visit for a colonoscopy. We found out immediately that our gastroenterologist, Dr. Corkum, said it appeared it was cancer in his colon.&lt;/p&gt;
