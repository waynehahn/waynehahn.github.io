        <title>The Waiting Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of every illness is the waiting game. Waiting for appointments, waiting for results &amp;amp; waiting, waiting,waiting.  We wouldn’t dare complain as we were so fortunate to get in with our doctors. Johns Hopkins is so different than I thought it would be.  We absolutely loved Mercy when Nikki started her treatments 4 years ago.  There wasn’t one thing about Mercy that we didn’t like.  Surprisingly, Hopkins has gained that “patient care” attitude.  We felt like we were the only patients there.  They could not be more caring.  As of now, the liver specialist, Dr. He, felt the spot was very small and he would take it out after chemo and radiation.  Our mode for Wayne is going to be 6 weeks of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation and 12 weeks off.  After that, Wayne will have surgery.  We feel very confident in our doctors and Wayne has a wonderful positive outlook.  We will get him through this.  We thank all our family and friends for their support. Wayne has been humbled by all the out pouring of prayers, notes &amp;amp; cards.  We are blessed!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MRI Results</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Results are in. They found a small lesion on Wayne’s liver. We were quite devastated but they feel that they can do surgery to remove it. The Doctors feel like between chemo, radiation and surgery, this cancer can be removed over a 6-8 month period&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Waiting Stage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess you can imagine the power of anxiety waiting for results.  We have decided to get up everyday and keep busy, meeting with friends, going out to lunch etc, just keep moving and worry less.  Wayne had his CAT scan, PET scan &amp;amp; finally his MRI this past Sunday.  Johns Hopkins has a wonderful campus.  Nikki &amp;amp; I found one of the really nice courtyards while Wayne was getting his tests.  We packed our iPhones, iPads, crosswords, bottles of water and made ourselves comfortable.  Afterwards we try to plan lunch or dinner with friends. Exploring the buildings, Nikki and I found the Dome area and the statue of Christ.  The artwork throughout is amazing.  It’s almost like being at an airport.  For techie people there are places to refuel your phones and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://waynehahn.github.io/img/jhjesus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Divine Healer by Danish sculptor, Bertel Thorvaldsen&quot; /&gt;
Here is the Jesus statue known as the “Divine Healer” or “Christ the Consoler.” The Carrera marble Jesus has arms out stretched, open in a gesture of welcome to all who wander in.
We have spent most of our time in the Zayed Building waiting…..Hopkins is an incredible place.  We feel blessed, strong and are really optimistic that Wayne will get the care that he needs to beat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What&#39;s Next</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We were recommended to see Dr. Donehower and Dr. Efron at Johns Hopkins by a friend. What a blessing that turned out to be. Wayne felt immediately comforted by their plan of action. A week of tests followed. Currently we are in the waiting stage for results. We were told that there were spots on his lung and liver but that could be scar tissue, we hope!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Beginning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On 9/2/2015, we created this site to keep it a little more personal than Facebook. Wayne had a routine visit for a colonoscopy. We found out immediately that our gastroenterologist, Dr. Corkum, said it appeared it was cancer in his colon.&lt;/p&gt;
