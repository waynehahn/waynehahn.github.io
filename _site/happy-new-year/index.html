<p>Happy New Year to everyone!  As always we thank you for all your prayers, all of your well-wishes, all of your support.  We have some really good news for you.  As good as Wayne’s CEA count was last time, it gets even better.</p>

<p>Wayne went for a CT scan along with his bloodwork on Monday.  Today he is having his 4th round of chemo.  Before he has chemo, Dr. Donehower, his oncologist, meets with us to discuss the results of his labwork.  Today’s discussion included his CT scan.  We are proud to say that there is no trace of cancer on his liver.  He said Wayne’s liver specialist, Dr. He, will still remove that sliver of his liver where the cancer was (in this case it’s good to use past tense!).   The cancer on the lower colon area has <em>SHRUNK</em>!!!!  It has gone from 1.5cm to 1.0cm in thickness!!!</p>

<p>Dr. Donehower said that he couldn’t believe 2 months into treatment,  Wayne would have as good an outcome as that so soon.  He also said that the conversation begins of curing Wayne of cancer.  Dr. Donehower has a tiny office, and it got smaller by four wide smiles in that room!</p>

<p>The doctors will have a conference next week about Wayne to decide if he will have radiation next.  Life is progressing on a very positive note.</p>

<p>Wayne must be feeling good, he’s been joking around with the nurses.  He did all he could this morning before the chemo.  He took out the trash, cleaned out the litter boxes, made us breakfast.  Nikki even had him make mashed potatoes for tonight.  We will post of picture later of how he will look when we leave chemo today.  He will resemble the Invisible Man, by the time he leaves.  Why?  There is a story that we didn’t share with you last time.</p>

<p>(From last treatment):  We were riding high from the good news about Wayne’s CEA count.  In the midst of chemo we were toying with the idea of having lunch after.  We blocked out how bad the Oxalyplaten makes him feel.  It’s immediate when the symptoms kick in.  He’s pretty miserable for the following days.  Being one not to complain, he stayed mum on some strange things he experienced while the Oxalyplaten was being infused during the 2 hours.  We finished &amp; left.  On the way down we talked of stopping at Eddie’s to get a few items.  As soon as the door opened to a breezy 45 degree day, Wayne didn’t look right.  3/4 of the way to the car, he started sneezing.  With that his throat closed up, he turned red then purple and kept gasping for air.  It was awful.  Nikki &amp; I got him back up to the chemo area.  You never saw so many nurses go right into action.  One rolled over a chair halfway across the room, another grabbed an iv, and put it in him, and the rest were either monitoring/helping him or getting the doctor.</p>

<p>Do you remember when we said that the doctor warned us about the cold?  I think the 3 of us took it that he would get cold, not that the cold would <em>get</em> him.  One of the side effects from Oxalyplaten is that when cold air hits the face/neck, your throat closes.  We will never forget that again.  Today he will wear a full ski mask, scarf &amp; be entirely zipped up.  No chances taken this time!</p>

<p>As soon as we hear word from Dr. Efron, his colorectal surgeon, we will post again.  Meanwhile the 3 of us wish you a happy holiday season.  Be safe, be merry, be healthy!</p>

<p>From our family to you,
Happy 2016,</p>

<p>With love, Frani, Wayne &amp; Nikki</p>
