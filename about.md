Everyone has an "about" page.  It is nice to know a little something about the subject.  The subject happens to be my father, Wayne Hahn.  He has been chosen as one of the unfortunate vessels for housing some repugnant cancer cells, much like I once was.  He was incredible throughout my battle, and now I have really big shoes to fill, giving back.  If I can do half of what he did for me, it will be a lot.  
His attitude is great.  He's very positive.  His humor is in high gear.  And as he refers to Mom and I, his team are in fighting form.  But there's one necessary cog to this cancer-killing engine I haven't yet mentioned---you.  Without the love, prayers, and support from all of you, it's not only helping my father, but all three of us.  Thank you!
